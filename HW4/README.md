# Homework 4 Neural Networks
This homework is divided into two parts.

The first part can be done on your local machine.

The second part (rain nowcasting) needs to be done on GPU. See [Gcloud setup](../gcloud/) for instructions on how to use Google Cloud for GPU training. **For those who does not want to use Gcloud, you can get the data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NWR22fVVE0tO2Q5EbaPPrRKPhUem-jbw/view?usp=sharing)**
