# Course Project (30 points)

## Team
Form a group of 4 people. A total of 30 points (bonus points excluded) are based on the course project.

## Proposal (1 point)
Submit your initial proposal on Mycourseville and signup for a meeting.

## Mid-project report (3 points)

Report due: Wednesday 6th November (midnight)<br/>
Update meeting: Thursday 7th November (16:10-6:00pm, 10 minute time slots)

A maximum of one page write-up summarizing what you have done. **This should include preliminary results.** For example, some results using a very simple model. This can be useful as a baseline for your project.

The mid-project report should include the following (but not limited to)

* What did you do in the previous two weeks?
* How does a simple model (for example, linear regression) do on your task/data? How does a majority rule do? 
* Any problems/obstacles?
* What do you plan to do in the next three weeks? Try to be specific on what each person in the group will be doing. More than one person can be working on the same part, but you should think about how to divide the work evenly.

## Presentation (12 points)

Presentation date: Tuesday 27th November<br/>
Slides due: Tuesday 27th November (midnight, after class)<br/>
Length: 15 minutes presentation, 5 minutes question answering

You will be presenting in class in front of your classmates and a panel of machine learning experts. Many of them are looking for potential data scientists, so they might be your future employers.

The presentation report should include the following (but not limited to)

* What is the task? Why is it important or why did you choose to do it?
* Literature review. What did other people use to do this task? What are the pros and cons of each method? Include at least 3 examples.
* What did you do? It can be the same as what other people used (if non-trivial). Why did you choose the models you use? Be sure to explain your model, if the method is not covered in class.
* What is the data? What is the class distribution? How is the train/dev/test data split?
* What is the evaluation criterion? If the criterion is not covered in class, you need to explain it.
* A comparison between the methods you use. What is the effect of tuning the hyperparameters?
* Error analysis. What kind of errors are common for each model you tried (give examples)? Can you explain why different models produce different kind of errors? For the safe driver prediction task, be sure to split out a development set, so that you can do these analysis.

The scoring criterion will be based on:

* Presentation (4 points)
* Appropriate use of machine learning techniques and models (4 points)
* Appropriate use of machine learning methodology (test/train/dev split, tuning, feature selection, metrics, and evaluation) (4 points)

## Write-up (14 points)

Write-up due: Sunday 10th December (**No extensions! Late submissions will cause a delay in your grade!**)

A maximum of four-page (double column) or eight-page (single column) write-up. Each group is encouraged to do the write-up in latex (3 bonus points).

See the write-up template for an example of what should be in the write-up. The content should be very similar to what you did for the presentation. You will be graded based-on the completeness of your write-up, and how you apply your understanding of course materials.

## Extra credits

* +3 points for using the Latex template provided.
* +1 points for popular vote.
* +3 points for novelty award. The judge panel will pick one or two groups that have the most clever application of machine learning knowledge.
